## Introduction

As defined by [Gartner](http://blogs.gartner.com/it-glossary/project-management/), project management is **the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements**.

Project management is an integral part of software engineering processes along with _business analysis_, _requirements specification_, _design_, _programming_, and _testing_.

Project management professionals define a **successful project** as NOT only the one that is completed on time and within budget BUT also as the one that **delivers expected benefits**.

## Project Management Phases

Regardless of the scope, any project should follow a sequence of actions to be controlled and managed. According to the [Project Management Institute(PMI)](http://www.pmi.org/), a typical project management process includes the following phases:

1. Initiation
2. Planning
3. Execution
4. Performance/Monitoring
5. Closure

:::important

Yet, this structure is too general. A project usually has a number of internal stages within each phase. They can vary greatly depending on the scope of _work_, the _team_, the _industry_, and the _project_ itself.

So in attempts to find a universal approach to MANAGING ANY PROJECT, humanity has developed a significant number of Project Management _techniques_ and _methodologies_.

:::

## Traditional Project Management Methodologies

Based on the above described phases, traditional methodologies take a **step-by-step approach** to managing the project. Thus, the project goes though the **initiation** phase, then the **planning** phase, then the **execution** phase, then the **performance** phase, and finally the **closure** phase in consecutive stages.

Often called **Linear**, this approach applied most commonly within the construction or manufacturing industry, where little or no changes are required at every stages. Traditional project management has found its application in software engineering as well. _(Waterfall Model)_

### Waterfall Model

It has been a dominant software development methodology since the early 1970s.

- Strong emphasis on planning and specifications development, which takes up to **40% of the project time and budget**.
- Basic principal for this approach is the **strict order** of the project phases. _(new project stage does not begin until the previous one is finished)_
- Works well for **clearly defined** projects with **single deliverable** and **fixed deadlines**.
- Requires **thorough planning**, **extensive documentation**, and **tight control** over the development process.
- In theory, it lead to _on-time_, _on-budget_, _low-risks_, and _predictable final result_. However, when applied to the actual software engineering process, it tends to be **slow**, **costly**, and **inflexible** due to numerous restrictions.
- In many cases, its **inability** to adjust the product to the evolving market requirements often results in a **huge waste of resources** and the eventual **PROJECT FAILURE**.

## Agile Project Management Philosophy

![methodology-agile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/158773193-5745d106-3468-479f-81dd-7627b3c07d39.png)

As opposed to the traditional approach, the **Agile Project Management Philosophy** has been introduced as an attempt to make software engineering more _flexible_ and _efficient_. It has quickly become **the industry standard for project management**. _(Estimated that about 95% of organizations have adopted Agile in one form or another)_

### Historical Background

The history of Agile can be traced back to **1957**, At that time _Bernie Dimsdale_, _Jhon Von Neumann_, _Herb Jacobs_, and _Gerald Weinberg_ were using incremental development techniques _(Agile now)_, building software for **IBM** and **MOTOROLA**. Although, not knowing how to classify the approach they were practicing, they realized clearly that it was different from Waterfall in many ways.

However, the modern-day Agile approach was officially introduced in **2001**, when a group of 17 software development professionals met to discuss alternative project management methodologies.Having a clear vision of the _flexible_, _lightweight_, and _team-oriented_ software development approach, they mapped it out in the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://agilemanifesto.org/)

:::info

The manifesto clearly specifies the fundamental principles of the new approach:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools.
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer collaboration** over contact negotiation.
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan.

:::

Agile methodologie takes an **iterative approach**. Unlike a straightforward linear Waterfall model, It consists of a number of smaller cycles **_Sprints_**. Each Sprint is a project in miniature: _(It has a backlog and consists of design, implementation, testing, and deployment stages )_.

![Process_Agile2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72823374/158772534-534d9865-f9d0-4d8c-b208-c34651158f0d.jpg)

At the end of each Sprint, a shippable **product increment** is delivered. Thus, with every Sprint, new features are added, resulting in **gradual project growth**.

:::note
Main Agile Aspects

- **Flexibility**: scope of work may change according to new requirements.
- **Work breakdown**: small cycles _(known as Springs in Scrum)_
- **Value of teamwork**: working members together with clear vision of their responsibilities.
- **Iterative improvement**: frequent reassessment of the work done within a cycle to make the final product better.
- **Cooperation with client**: custemer is closely engaged in the development and can change the requirements or accept the team's suggestions.
