2022 is here and we are excited to announce the start of our workshops, events and activities. With the launch of our new webapp, we are going to be able to offer a more efficient, reactive and interactive way of learning.

## What is our plan?

In our Workshops, events and collaborations cell, we are going to learn new skills together, to practice them in our projects and to share knowledge between each other. We are going to create events and collaborate with other clubs and organizations to create innovative projects. So be there and join us! We are going to have a lot of fun together this year.
